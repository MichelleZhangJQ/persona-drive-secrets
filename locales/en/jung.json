      "surface1": "In our framework, Surface Persona is closest to Jung’s ego-facing layer: your conscious, deliberate way of showing up—how you explain yourself, steer behavior, and manage impressions. Jung also emphasized that the ego sits atop a much larger unconscious (including disowned traits, unrealized potentials, and autonomous tendencies).",
      "surface2": "Our Innate Persona is not the unconscious, and we don’t call it an “unconscious persona.” Instead, it’s the hidden-but-knowable baseline: stable underlying preferences and drive-structure that shape what feels natural and sustaining, often outside awareness unless measured directly. Many people miss this baseline because their Surface Persona is trained by roles, demands, and adaptation.",
      "surface3": "When the Surface Persona becomes too dominant—when a role becomes “who I am”—Jung’s warning applies: what doesn’t fit gets pushed down and may return as shadow reactions (friction, defensiveness, compulsive patterns). Growth, in Jung’s view, is individuation: bringing the surface self into better alignment with what lies underneath, so the mask stays useful—but not mistaken for the whole person.",
